# ANNOUNCEMENT CARD - TEXT VISIBILITY FIX

## Summary

Fixed the Recipients, Created, and Published field values in announcement cards to be dark blue for better visibility.

---

## ✅ Problem Identified

### Issue:

In the **Announcement Manager** page, the individual announcement blocks had white/light text for these fields:

- **Recipients:** (value was light colored)
- **Created:** (date value was light colored)
- **Published:** (date value was light colored)

This made the text difficult or impossible to read against the card background.

---

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### Changed `.detail-value` Styling:

**Before:**

```css
.detail-value {
  font-weight: 500;
  color: #243b6b; /* Light blue - poor visibility */
  flex: 1;
}
```

**After:**

```css
.detail-value {
  font-weight: 600; /* Increased from 500 to 600 for better readability */
  color: #1e3a5f !important; /* Dark blue - excellent visibility */
  flex: 1;
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. ✅ **Color:** `#243b6b` → `#1e3a5f` (dark blue)
2. ✅ **Font Weight:** `500` → `600` (semi-bold for emphasis)
3. ✅ **!important Flag:** Ensures no style conflicts

## 📋 Affected Fields

All announcement cards now have **dark blue, bold text** for these values:

### Detail Fields:

- **Recipients:** "all" | "members" | "staff" | "specific"
- **Created:** "October 17, 2025" format
- **Published:** "October 17, 2025" format
- **Scheduled:** "October 17, 2025" format (when applicable)

## 🎨 Design Consistency

### Color Scheme Alignment:

- **Labels** (Recipients:, Created:, Published:)
  - Color: `#1e3a5f` (dark blue)
  - Font Weight: `600` (semi-bold)
- **Values** (all, October 17, 2025, etc.)
  - Color: `#1e3a5f` (dark blue) **← NOW MATCHING**
