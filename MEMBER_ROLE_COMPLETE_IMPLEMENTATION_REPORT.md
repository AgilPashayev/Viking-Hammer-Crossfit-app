---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **Step 1: Apply Database Migrations**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor or via CLI:
-- 1. user_settings table
\i infra/supabase/migrations/20251019_user_settings.sql

-- 2. announcements RLS policies
\i infra/supabase/policies/announcements_rls.sql
```

### **Step 2: Verify Backend**
```powershell
# Backend should already be running on port 4001
# Verify new endpoints:
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:4001/api/health" -Method GET

# Test invitation validation (should fail gracefully):
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:4001/api/invitations/test-token" -Method GET
```

### **Step 3: Start Frontend**
```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Should start on http://localhost:5173
```

### **Step 4: Test Invitation Registration**
```
Navigate to: http://localhost:5173?invitation=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
Should load InvitationRegistration component
```

## 📊 INTEGRATION VALIDATION

### **Cross-Layer Integration:**

✅ **Database ↔ Backend API**
- All new tables have corresponding API endpoints
- RLS policies enforced at database level
- Backend respects RLS when using Supabase client

✅ **Backend API ↔ Frontend**
- All API endpoints called from frontend components
- Proper error handling on both sides
- Loading states prevent race conditions

✅ **Component Integration**
- `InvitationRegistration` → `AuthForm` (redirect after success)
- `MemberDashboard` → Announcements API (live data)
- `MyProfile` → Settings API (persist across sessions)
- `App.tsx` routing handles all new pages

✅ **No Conflicts**
- New endpoints do not override existing routes
- Component state management isolated
- CSS classes namespaced properly
- No TypeScript compilation errors (except pre-existing Sparta.tsx issues)

---

## 🎯 PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### **Optimizations Implemented:**

1. **Announcements Auto-Refresh**
   - Polling interval: 5 minutes (not too aggressive)
   - Cleanup on component unmount (prevents memory leaks)
   - Loading state prevents multiple concurrent requests

2. **Settings Loading**
   - Loads once on component mount
   - Only fetches when user ID is available
   - Default settings returned if none exist (no 404 error)

3. **Invitation Token Validation**
   - Validates immediately on page load
   - Shows loading spinner during validation
   - Caches validation result (no repeated API calls)

4. **Backend Efficiency**
   - Upsert for settings (no need to check if exists first)
   - Database indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Proper SQL filtering at database level (not in code)

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### **Minor Issues:**

1. **Node.js Version Warning** ⚠️
   - Backend shows warning: "Node.js 18 deprecated"
   - **Impact:** None (still works)
   - **Fix:** Upgrade to Node.js 20+ in future

2. **Sparta.tsx TypeScript Errors** (Pre-existing)
   - QR validation property name mismatch
   - Stats property name mismatch
   - **Impact:** None (code still runs)
   - **Fix:** Update property names to match QRCodeService

3. **Email Verification on Profile Update** (Not Implemented)
   - Members can change email without verification
   - **Impact:** Low (security consideration)
   - **Fix:** Add email verification flow when email changes

### **Not Implemented (Low Priority):**

- Push notification device token registration (backend endpoint exists, not wired up)
- Rate limiting on invitation creation
- CAPTCHA on invitation registration page
- Audit logging for sensitive changes
