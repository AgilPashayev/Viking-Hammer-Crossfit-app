# Login Issue - Fixed

## Problem

"Invalid email or password" error when trying to login.

## Root Cause

The auto-cleanup code was **TOO AGGRESSIVE**:

- It cleared **ALL** demo users if **ANY** had old format
- This deleted valid new users along with old ones
- Login failed because user account was removed

## Fix Applied

Updated `App.tsx` (lines 44-85) to be **SELECTIVE**:

**Before:**

```typescript
// Cleared ALL users if ANY were old format ❌
if (hasOldFormat) {
  localStorage.removeItem('viking_demo_users');
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Only removes old users, keeps new ones ✅
Object.keys(users).forEach((email) => {
  if (user.profile.id.startsWith('demo-')) {
    delete users[email]; // Remove only this user
  }
});
// Save remaining users back
localStorage.setItem('viking_demo_users', JSON.stringify(users));
```

## What It Does Now

1. ✅ Scans each demo user individually
2. ✅ Removes ONLY users with old `"demo-{timestamp}"` IDs
3. ✅ **Keeps** users with UUID format
4. ✅ Saves cleaned user list back to localStorage
5. ✅ Logs out current user if they have old format

## Action Required

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R)
2. Sign up as new demo user
3. Login will work ✅

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Selective cleanup implemented.
