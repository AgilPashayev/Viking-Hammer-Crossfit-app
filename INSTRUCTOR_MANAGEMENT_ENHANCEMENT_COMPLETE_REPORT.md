## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Architecture Enhancements:

**State Management Additions:**

```typescript
// New state variables for enhanced functionality
const [members, setMembers] = useState<Member[]>([]);
const [selectedMember, setSelectedMember] = useState<Member | null>(null);
const [memberSearchTerm, setMemberSearchTerm] = useState('');
const [showMemberDropdown, setShowMemberDropdown] = useState(false);
const [showScheduleAssignModal, setShowScheduleAssignModal] = useState(false);
const [instructorToSchedule, setInstructorToSchedule] = useState<Instructor | null>(null);
const [showDeleteConfirmModal, setShowDeleteConfirmModal] = useState(false);
const [instructorToDelete, setInstructorToDelete] = useState<Instructor | null>(null);
```

**Service Integrations:**

- ‚úÖ `memberService.getAllMembers()` - Fetch active members
- ‚úÖ `authService.isSparta()` - Role-based access control
- ‚úÖ `classService.update()` - Class-instructor assignments

**Utility Functions Added:**

```typescript
// Member filtering and selection utilities
getActiveMembers() - Filter members by active status
getFilteredMembers() - Search members by name/email
handleMemberSelect() - Auto-fill form from selected member
resetInstructorForm() - Reset form and selection state

// Enhanced scheduling functions
handleScheduleInstructor() - Open schedule assignment modal
handleAssignClassToInstructor() - Assign/remove class assignments
