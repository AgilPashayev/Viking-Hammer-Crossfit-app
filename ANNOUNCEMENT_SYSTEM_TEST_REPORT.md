## üöÄ MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### Quick Test Steps:

1. **Open Frontend:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

2. **Insert Test Announcements (Run in Supabase SQL Editor):**
   ```sql
   -- Get a real user ID first
   SELECT id, email, role FROM public.users_profile LIMIT 5;
   
   -- Replace 'YOUR-USER-ID-HERE' with actual user ID from above
   INSERT INTO public.announcements (title, content, target_audience, priority, status, created_by, published_at)
   VALUES 
   ('üèãÔ∏è New CrossFit Class Schedule - FROM RECEPTION', 
    'Exciting news! We have added new morning CrossFit classes starting next week. Check the schedule for details.',
    'members', 'high', 'published', 'YOUR-USER-ID-HERE', NOW()),
   ('‚öîÔ∏è Sparta Challenge This Weekend - FROM SPARTA',
    'Join us for the ultimate Sparta Challenge this Saturday! Test your strength, endurance, and determination.',
    'members', 'urgent', 'published', 'YOUR-USER-ID-HERE', NOW()),
   ('üì¢ Welcome to Viking Hammer CrossFit!',
    'This is a test announcement. You should see this as a popup notification. Click Enable Push Notifications!',
    'all', 'normal', 'published', 'YOUR-USER-ID-HERE', NOW());
   ```

3. **Test as Member:**
   - Login as MEMBER user
   - Announcement popup should appear immediately ‚úÖ
   - Click "Enable Push Notifications" ‚úÖ
   - Grant permission when prompted ‚úÖ
   - Test notification should display ‚úÖ
   - Click "Got it!" to close modal ‚úÖ

4. **Test Read Tracking:**
   - Refresh page (F5)
   - Popup should NOT appear again ‚úÖ
   - Announcements still visible in dashboard ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Foreign Key Constraint:**
   - `created_by` field requires a real user UUID
   - Cannot create announcements without valid user reference
   - **Workaround:** Use actual logged-in user ID or insert via SQL with real user ID

2. **VAPID Keys:**
   - Push notification service uses placeholder VAPID key
   - **Action Required:** Generate real VAPID keys for production
   - Command: `web-push generate-vapid-keys`

3. **Service Worker Registration:**
   - Not auto-registered on app load
   - **Action Required:** Add registration in main.tsx or App.tsx

---

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Add User Context to Announcement Creation:**
   - Use authenticated user's ID automatically for `created_by`
   - Remove manual `createdBy` field from frontend form

2. **Create Announcement Management UI:**
   - Add "Announcements" tab for Reception/Sparta/Admin roles
   - Form with: Title, Content, Target Audience, Priority
   - List view with edit/delete capabilities

3. **Generate Production VAPID Keys:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g web-push
   web-push generate-vapid-keys
   ```

4. **Service Worker Auto-Registration:**
   - Add to `frontend/src/main.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
     navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');
   }
   ```

5. **Production Push Notifications:**
   - Integrate with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for mobile
   - Or use Web Push library for browser notifications
